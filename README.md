Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a life long learner and I am into building modern web and mobile apps using technologies I actually enjoy working with. Whether it's crafting slick UIs with Angular or building cross-platform apps with .NET MAUI ‚Äî I'm all in.

## üå± Currently Learning

- Getting deeper into **.NET MAUI**, but also **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** and mobile UI/UX  
- Leveling up my **Angular** game (RxJS, state management, best practices)  
- Automating boring stuff with **Python** (because why not)
